## KEY INSIGHTS FOR MODELING

### Class Imbalance
- Severe imbalance with ~11% positive class
- Requires careful handling: resampling, class weights, or appropriate metrics

### Feature Importance Indicators
1. **Duration**: Strongest predictor but has post-event bias
2. **Previous campaign outcomes**: Success breeds success
3. **Contact timing**: Certain months show 4-5x higher success rates
4. **Demographics**: Age, job type, and education level matter

### Data Challenges
1. High percentage of "unknown" in critical features
2. Post-event bias in duration variable
3. Temporal patterns suggest seasonality effects
4. Economic context variables only in one dataset version

### Recommended Approach
1. Use bank-full.csv for main model development
2. Consider bank-additional-full.csv for models incorporating economic context
3. Handle class imbalance appropriately
4. Be cautious with duration feature due to causality issues
5. Engineer features from temporal patterns
6. Consider treating "unknown" as separate category vs. imputation

## Dataset Usage Recommendations

- **For Initial Exploration**: Use bank.csv (faster processing)
- **For Final Model Training**: Use bank-full.csv (complete data)
- **For Advanced Models**: Use bank-additional-full.csv (economic context)
- **For Model Evaluation**: Focus on precision-recall metrics, ROC-AUC, and lift curves given the imbalanced nature
